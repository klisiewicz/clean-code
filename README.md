## Descritpion

 Uncle Bob complies by walking through the famous example of The Bowling Game. (You don't want to miss this!) In this example, Uncle Bob uses the three laws and the Red-Green-Refactor cycle to implement the algorithm for scoring games of ten-pin bowling.

The demonstration begins with a quick description of the scoring rules. Then, Uncle Bob leads us on a quick UML design session. TDD commences, and we watch Uncle Bob create the algorithm by applying the three laws of TDD in the Red-Green-Refactor cycle. Finally, the end result is compared to the initial design.
