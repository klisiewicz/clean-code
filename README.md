# Advanced TDD

[Clean Code: Advanced TDD, Episode 19](https://cleancoders.com/episode/clean-code-episode-19-p1).

## Descritpion

In this episode we're going to do a deep dive into the three laws of TDD with lots of code examples. We'll study the process of TDD in minute detail as we gradually build a simple program to invert names.

As we explore the three rules, we'll also start the discussion about The Single Assert Rule, and then we'll set that aside for more exploration in a future episode.
