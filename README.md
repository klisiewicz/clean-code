# Clean Code

Screencasts from the [Clean Code](https://cleancoders.com/) series.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo. Switch to the branch with a corresponding screen cast:

* [testable-html](https://github.com/klisiewicz/clean-code/tree/testable-html) - [Testable Html](https://cleancoders.com/video-details/clean-code-episode-3-sc-1-testable-html). This is the first of three screencasts for Clean Code Episode 3: Functions. The focus in this cast is on small functions and refactoring technique.
* [prime-generator](https://github.com/klisiewicz/clean-code/tree/prime-generator) - [Prime Generator](https://cleancoders.com/video-details/clean-code-episode-3-sc-2-prime). In this screencast, Uncle Bob refactors the famous Prime Number Generator from Donald Knuth's landmark book, Literate Programming. This screencast focuses on finding multiple classes buried within single, long functions.
* [video-store](https://github.com/klisiewicz/clean-code/tree/video-store) - [Video Store](https://cleancoders.com/video-details/clean-code-episode-3-sc-3-videostore). This is the famous "Video Store" example from Martin Fowler's book, Refactoring. In this screencast, Uncle Bob takes it apart one step at a time. In the end, he will transform this code from a single large function in a group of otherwise empty classes, into a nicely partitioned object oriented design.
* [stack](https://github.com/klisiewicz/clean-code/tree/stack) - [Stack](https://cleancoders.com/video-details/clean-code-episode-4-sc-1-stack). In this screencast, Uncle Bob performs the famous Stack kata, developing a simple Stack data structure driven by tests.
* [lychrel](https://github.com/klisiewicz/clean-code/tree/lychrel) - [Lychrel](https://cleancoders.com/video-details/clean-code-episode-5-sc-1-lychrel). It's been said that it's impossible to test drive an algorithm to generate Lychrel numbers. Well then, this screen cast is an attempt to achieve the impossible.
* [bowling](https://github.com/klisiewicz/clean-code/tree/bowling) - [Bowling Game](https://cleancoders.com/video-details/clean-code-episode-6-p2). Uncle Bob walks through the famous example of The Bowling Game. In this example, Uncle Bob uses the three laws and the Red-Green-Refactor cycle to implement the algorithm for scoring games of ten-pin bowling.
